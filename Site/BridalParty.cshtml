        </hgroup>
        <p>I have known Emily since kindergarten, when I asked her if she wanted to play with the blocks with me. 
        Emily and I graduated high school together and attended University of North Dakota together. Emily now 
        lives in Devils Lake, ND where she is a special education teacher. Although we are many miles apart she
        is someone who I can call at any hour and pick up right where we left off!</p>

        <p>I have known Christy since we were 4 years old. We grew up across the street from each other and our 
        parents still live across the street today. Christy and I both graduated high school together. We also 
        both attended University of North Dakota together and attended graduate school to become Occupational

            <h4>Tamira Bass</h4>
            <h5>Friend of the Bride</h5>
        </hgroup>
        <p>I met Tamira 5 years ago when we were doing our Occupational Therapy internships at Western State 
        Hospital in Seattle. We had both moved out here without knowing anyone and became close friends very
        quickly during those 3 months. One year later, Tamira and I both decided to move to Seattle to start
        our careers. Matthew and I have become very close to Tamira and her husband Gary over the past few 
        years. We are also very blessed to have inherited their beautiful daugther Aleanna as our niece!</p>

            <h4>Molly Nolan</h4>
            <h5>Friend of the Bride</h5>
        </hgroup>
        <p>I met Molly 4 years ago at a Low Vision Rehabilitation class. Both of us attended alone and I was 
        new to the area so I thought I would spark up a conversation. Our friendship as grown significantly 
        over the past few years and she always challenges me to try new things or go out of my comfort zone!
        Thanks to Molly, I got interested in snowboarding, hiking, and many other activities that the Pacific 
        Northwest has to offer. Whether we are on the slopes or drinking wine and chatting over dinner, we always 
        seems to have a great time together.</p>

        </hgroup>
        <p>Erika and I have many great memories together and she is someone I can count on to always have a good time 
        with when we are together. We have spent many summers together, whether it was in Florida at her house or 
        Bemidji at the lake cabin. I value Erika's opinion of fashion and style, as well as her honesty with me
        about anything...which is exactly why I chose her for my personal attendant.</p>

            <h4>Brad Wilson</h4>
            <h5>Friend of the Groom</h5>
        </hgroup>
        <p>I met Brad while working at Microsoft about a year after starting. We quickly became friends through our 
        main shared interests, including but not limited to, movies, board games, photography, and a quirky sense of 
        humor. While originally from Michigan, via Colorado, Brad currently lives in Redmond, WA and we are lucky 
        enough to get to hang out each day at work and during out weekly board game night.</p>

            <h4>Adam Silewski</h4>
            <h5>Brother of the Bride</h5>
        </hgroup>
        <p>I first met Adam when he picked Holly and I up at the Fargo, ND airport and drove us to her Grandmother’s 
        house, through a snow storm, for Thanksgiving. I remember vividly the first time I spent a significant amount 
        of time with Adam and the only thing that I will say about that is that I no longer have two problems! Adam 
        currently lives in Bemidji, MN where he enjoys the great outdoors, including hunting and fishing.</p>

            <h4>Jim Wang</h4>
            <h5>Friend of the Groom</h5>
        </hgroup>
        <p>Jim and I were officemates, new hires often have to share a private office, at Microsoft our first year 
        working there. As we were both starting out and spent all day in the same office we quickly became friends. 
        One of my favorite memories with Jim was getting to spend the weekend in Las Vegas, NV for my twenty second 
        birthday. Jim currently lives in Redmond, WA and enjoys photography, Intermural activities, and is very 
        active in his church. </p>

            <h4>Jeff Wilcox</h4>
            <h5>Friend of the Groom</h5>
        </hgroup>
        <p>I met Jeff during my first interview at Microsoft, yes that is right Jeff helped get me hired at Microsoft 
        for better or worse. We became friends through shared interests and over a few beers. During my first year at 
        Microsoft we worked on the same team and due to the many similarities people started referring to me as Jeff’s 
        clone, all be it a much better looking and more successful clone. Jeff currently resides in Seattle, WA 
        originating from Michigan.</p>
