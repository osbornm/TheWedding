<p>There are several ways to get from and to the airport all of varying levels of complexity and excitement. First, and 
simplest, would be to hire a taxi. This will cost around $32 each way and can easily be hailed at the airport and at the 
hotels. If you would like to try a more adventurous form of taxi check out a Seattle and San Francisco only service called 
<a href="https://www.uber.com/cities/seattle">Uber</a>. Second, and most adventurous, would be to take the 
<a href="http://www.soundtransit.org">Seattle Light Rail</a> from the airport to Westlake Center and then walk or get a 
taxi to your hotel. The Light Rail takes approximately 39 minutes to get to downtown and will cost about $3 per person. 
Lastly, would be to rent a car. We would advise against this unless you are staying an extended period of time, mainly because 
hotels do charge for parking and the hotels are located close to the heart of the activities, The Edgewater Hotel. </p>
